# Changelog

All notable changes to this toolkit are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow semantic versioning. The **toolkit version** (this file, git tags, the `TOOLKIT vX.Y.Z` marker in the `studio_primer.md` header) is independent of the `version: 1.0` line inside `style_guide.yaml` — that is the *schema* version, unchanged in 2.0.0 because all enum changes are additive.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-19

Style presets: ready-made style guides shipped in the repo, loadable without the `STYLE` step.

### Added
- **`LOAD` command** — the ANALYZER's third entry point (§3): paste a complete `style_guide.yaml` (a `presets/` file, or a guide saved from an earlier chat) and the primer validates it against §1 (unparseable YAML, missing `version:`, unknown fields, non-§1 enum values, single-value fields written as lists → ALL reported in one `LOAD ERRORS` block, nothing adopted, never guess-patched), adopts it **verbatim** (human-final; confidence preserved, absent confidence → 1.0 per filled block), reprints it in full, and proceeds exactly as after `STYLE`. An attached image is ignored with a note (`LOAD` takes styles from YAML, `STYLE` from images). Wired through every command surface: §0 table, §0 points 3 (bare pasted-guide dispatch) & 5, §0.5 row, §0.6 gate/receipts (`# CONSISTENCY: LOAD`; a rejected `LOAD`'s receipt is the `LOAD ERRORS` block), §3 block with its own OUTPUT SKELETON, FINAL CONTRACT item 3, BUILD MANIFEST. This also formalizes the previously informal "save your `style_guide.yaml` and paste it back next time" tip — resuming a game in a new chat is now a defined path.
- **`presets/` directory** — pre-authored `style_guide.yaml` DATA files (inputs for `LOAD`; never bundled into the primer, never a render path) + `presets/README.md` catalog with usage, authoring guide and copyright policy. First preset: **`turkish-casual.yaml` (DRAFT)** — the polished Turkish casual-mobile look (glossy saturated cute-casual, chunky rounded UI, candy palette, heavy gloss), all `confidence: 1.0`, hex marked as estimates pending refinement against real refs. Inspiration screenshots stay in the new gitignored `presets/refs/` (same policy as `doc/`).
- **Preset validator** (CLAUDE.md verification): Ruby-stdlib one-liner asserting every enum-shaped scalar in every preset exists in `schema/style_guide.schema.yaml`'s enums (+ `version` present); YAML-parse checks extended to `presets/*.yaml`; three new manifest markers (`LOAD`, `adopted verbatim`, `LOAD ERRORS`).

### Notes
- The style_guide *schema* version stays `1.0` — no schema fields changed; presets are instances of the existing schema.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-07-09

Second consistency pass, from cross-checking an external (Codex) repo review — no behavior changes.

### Fixed
- **`layout_spec` enums bundled into §4.** The §4 layout_spec line was the only one of the five spec lines that didn't list its enum values inline — `canvas.safe_area` (mobile | tablet | none), `panel.align` (center | top | bottom | left | right), `header.close_button` (top_right | top_left | none) and `content.type` (vertical_list | horizontal_list | grid) were missing from the primer entirely.
- **§4 dispatch wording: "character or object" → "character or background".** The optional style_guide blocks are `character`/`material.character` (characters) and `environment`/`material.environment` (backgrounds); the object class has no dedicated block — it uses `material_hint`, else the closest style_guide material. The old sentence made `OBJECT:` runs report missing data that was never supposed to exist.
- **Token↔primer sync, round 2 (typography + controls).** The v2.1.1 re-bundle missed §2 `typography`/`controls` — meaning-carrying words from `style_tokens/ui_components.yaml` had been condensed away ("with friendly even strokes", "thick confident strokes", "casual bounce", "gentle rounded serifs", "no extra effect", "for pop", "with a clean highlight", "with soft bevel", "fully rounded capsule", the full per-enum knob/handle/check_style phrases, "heavy / black weight"). Restored verbatim from the tokens; purely mechanical color-role templates (`<accent/primary/secondary>`) stay merged.

### Added
- **Scoped enum-coverage verification check** (CLAUDE.md): a Ruby-stdlib one-liner that extracts every enum value containing `_` from `schema/*.yaml` and fails if any is absent from `studio_primer.md` (one-word enums like grid/none/center would always false-pass a grep, so they're deliberately out of scope). It catches exactly the class of drift fixed above.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-08

Consistency pass from a full repo review — no behavior changes, the repo now satisfies its own invariants again.

### Removed
- **`examples/` deleted entirely** (settings_screen, mascot_character, analyzer_smoke_test). The hand-written sample outputs kept drifting out of sync with every §4 rule change (the review found `prompt.txt` no longer derivable — missing the rule-7 tail, no COLOR LOCK, style_guide missing `camera`/`color_map`) and re-deriving them by hand on each release was pure maintenance cost. The `demo/` folder — real generated outputs — remains the showcase; README/CLAUDE.md references cleaned up.

### Fixed
- **Token↔primer wording sync** (the primer is GENERATED from `style_tokens/`, so the token files are canonical — primer §2 re-bundled to match them): `negative_map.dark_theme` ("black background unless specified"), `noisy_texture` (re-adds "microscopic details"), `katya_line_removal` (re-adds vector lines / drawn lines / black borders / manga), `katya_general_negatives` (re-adds "black"), `material_button.fabric` ("velvety / mossy / fluffy / fuzzy") and `.painted` ("imitation of…") — six §2 phrases had drifted from their source tokens during earlier hand-condensed rebuilds.
- **§0.5 single-asset row**: added the missing `saturation` to "icons add icon.perspective/padding/composition/saturation" (the §4 UI prompt order already required it).
- **CLAUDE.md verification**: documented the PyYAML dependency and added a Ruby fallback one-liner for the YAML parse check.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-08

Driven by a user-run GPT-5.5 review of the Brawl Stars-ref debug series: `shape.language: rounded` alone still pulled generators back to soft candy pills, and shape stated ONCE globally let every panel/card/tab drift rounded.

### Added
- **`shape.ui_panel_geometry`** (OPTIONAL: soft_rounded / square_chunky / arcade_slanted / parallelogram / trapezoid_card) — the panel/card/tab/button silhouette ARCHETYPE (`slant` remains the skew degree). Phrases are silhouette-only (no corner/camera words — token purity); new §2 group (39 headings). Analyzer pairing rule: arcade_slanted/parallelogram ⇒ `slant` filled; soft_rounded ⇒ `slant` absent; the `# CONSISTENCY:` receipt gains a `panel=<archetype/omitted — why>` observed slot.
- **SHAPE LOCK (§4, the per-surface twin of the COLOR LOCK):** when `ui_panel_geometry` and/or `slant` is filled, the prompt ECHOES the silhouette on EVERY UI surface class (main panels, product cards, tabs, buttons, nav buttons, badges/ribbons) instead of one global mention, and the chunky/slanted archetypes append the shape-lock negative "soft pill-shaped panels, overly rounded candy cards" to "Avoid:". `# SELF-CHECK:` gains a `shape lock on surfaces ✓/n-a` item; §5 CHECK flags any single pill-rounded surface on a slanted-archetype guide as `off`. When both fields are absent, nothing changes (existing examples unaffected).

## [2.0.4] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Negative-contradiction check is now observed-value too.** A v2.0.3 run printed `negatives-vs-filled-fields ✓ (none conflict)` while `dark_theme` sat in `negative` over a `#40144E` deep-purple background — the item was still a rubber-stamp ✓. The `# CONSISTENCY:` receipt item becomes `negatives vs filled: bg=<hex> reads <dark/light> ⇒ <dropped: …/none conflict>`; the §3 bullet states that deep purples/navies/charcoals ARE dark (judge by the emitted hex, not mood). Receipt rule generalized: every `<…>` slot must state what was seen.

### Notes
- The same v2.0.3 run validated the shape gate: the receipt honestly reported `slant=none · lettering=upright` — when that happens on a genuinely slanted ref it is a host **vision** limit, not a compliance failure; the designed remedy is the human `UPDATE:` override (`shape.slant = strong, typography.font_feel = italic_display`), which pins those fields at confidence 1.0 — the shape-trait analogue of eyedropper-verifying hex.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Slant/italic/corner capture is now gate-enforced, not prose-advised.** A real v2.0.2 run (GPT-5.5, Brawl Stars ref) still emitted `corner_radius: medium`, no `shape.slant`, `font_feel: bold_display` while printing a clean `# CONSISTENCY:` receipt — the receipt had no shape item, so the §3 rule-2 prose was skipped. §3's Consistency check gains a **Shape re-measure** bullet (look at the ref again: slanted/skewed panels ⇒ `shape.slant`; italic lettering ⇒ `italic_display`; corner radius measured, never habit-defaulted to medium) and the `# CONSISTENCY:` receipt gains three **observed-value slots** (`shape re-measured: slant=… · lettering=… · corners=…`) that must state what was seen — a rubber-stamp ✓ is no longer possible. §0.5 STYLE row and FINAL CONTRACT REMINDER line 3 restate it.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **`shape.slant`** (OPTIONAL: slight / strong) — skewed / parallelogram panels, tabs and banners ("arcade" diagonal energy à la Brawl Stars) are now a capturable trait instead of being normalized to rounded upright shapes; new §2 group `### shape.slant`.
- **`typography.font_feel: italic_display`** — heavy italic display lettering with a forward slant.

### Fixed
- **Every ref no longer gets "rounded-corner-ified."** §3 now instructs the analyzer to treat slanted tabs / skewed banners / italic lettering as a distinct trait and to MEASURE `corner_radius` against the ref (crisp arcade cards = `small`, candy-casual = `large`) instead of defaulting to medium/rounded.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Aspect ratio no longer hard-defaults to 9:16 portrait.** New `style_guide.canvas` block (orientation + "W:H" estimate) that the ANALYZER reads off the ref images themselves; §4 rule 5 now resolves aspect ratio by priority — explicit spec/request → TARGET ref's own canvas → `style_guide.canvas` → per-asset-type default only when all are absent. A landscape ref yields a landscape asset. CHECK compares canvas orientation/ratio for screens; the `# SELF-CHECK:` receipt gains an "aspect ratio sourced" item.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-07

The style-neutral + compliance-gated engine. Driven by a real-run debug series (SHOP-screen ref on GPT-5.5): first removing a hidden "casual house style" bias, then hardening the primer against stochastic host-LLM non-compliance.

### Changed
- **Style-neutral engine**: the prompt opener is now SYNTHESIZED from the style_guide (`"Generate a {genre} {platform} game art asset in {rendering-family} style:"`) instead of the hard-coded "casual mobile game" phrase; token phrases express only their enum's meaning (cross-dimension adjectives like "soft/friendly/toy-like/stylized-not-realistic" removed from lighting, shape, metal, proportions phrases); `negative` is ref-derived, never a stock list — a dark/gritty ref bans cute/pastel instead of banning itself.
- `style_guide.color_map` (COLOR LOCK) is now **CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED** — must be filled whenever the refs show UI.
- §5 CHECK is **format-locked**: binary ok/off table (including an entry-points row) + per-fix `TWEAK:` lines + one consolidated `TWEAK:` — no scores, no essays; TWEAKs may only pull the image TOWARD the style_guide (no "art-director" suggestions).
- §5 edge-sharpness judging is conditioned on the style contract (intentional brushwork/grain/pixel/CRT are not defects for styles that declare them).

### Added
- Enum coverage for non-casual styles: `style.mood` dark register (dark, grim, tense, eerie, melancholic), `style.rendering` realistic_painted / inked_comic, `material.character` realistic_painted, `lighting.direction` side / below, optional `lighting.contrast` (soft/medium/hard), `environment.atmosphere` fog / gloom / storm, `project.genre` action / adventure / horror; negative_map entries for dark styles (cute, pastel_palette, toy_gloss, bright_cheerful).
- **§0.6 OUTPUT GATE**: every answer is drafted → verified against its §0.5 checklist row → revised until it passes → printed with a receipt line (`# CONSISTENCY:` for the analyzer, `# SELF-CHECK:` closing every synthesizer ASSUMPTIONS block, the fixed table for CHECK).
- **OUTPUT SKELETON** opening §3/§4/§5 (the entire reply is exactly the defined blocks — no intro sentence, no invented sections) and a **FINAL CONTRACT REMINDER** closing the primer (recency anchor).
- §3 Consistency check: list discipline (only genre/mood/palette/color_map/background.color/negative are lists), negative-vs-filled-field contradiction check, color_map requirement, confidence↔block pairing.
- §4 rules 12–14: prompts are flowing prose and self-contained (never referencing "the style guide"); one entry point per feature per screen (deduped, checked again by CHECK); mandatory self-check receipt. §4 rule 6 contradiction guard skips negatives that contradict filled fields. Closed element lists (no "such as") + "no additional UI elements beyond those listed" tail.
- §0 dispatch rule: an image with no command is never free-form described (no style_guide yet → run STYLE; otherwise ask which command it belongs to).
- Camera hint: flat UI screens/mockups = orthographic.
- `TOOLKIT vX.Y.Z` version marker in the primer header (Ctrl+F it in a chat to know which build is pasted).

### Fixed
- Analyzer self-sabotage: `dark_theme`/`realistic`/`gritty` no longer land in `negative` when the ref itself is dark/realistic/gritty.
- Duplicate feature entry points (e.g. Shop in a floating button AND the bottom nav) in self-suggested screen layouts.
- Detached end-of-prompt color lists — hex now stays inline per surface.
- `platform` and other single-value fields emitted as lists.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06 (untagged)

Initial draw-fresh toolkit: `studio_primer.md` bundled from `schema/` + `style_tokens/`; commands STYLE / UPDATE: / ASSET: / CHARACTER: / BACKGROUND: / OBJECT: / CHECK / REGEN / TWEAK; four generate branches, UI-kit & character sheets, pose-variation image-edit path, COLOR LOCK, EXECUTION CHECKLIST. (EXTRACT / UPSCALE / design-system board paths removed by design — draw-fresh only.)
